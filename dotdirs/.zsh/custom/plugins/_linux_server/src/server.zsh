##### LOGGING USERS
# you can find who logged in when (and from where) in the file:
### On Ubuntu servers, 
# /var/log/auth.log
### On Red Hat based distros such as Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:
# /var/log/secure.


### If you want to have login attempts included in the log file, 
# you'll need to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file (as root or with sudo) 
# and change the LogLevel from INFO to VERBOSE.


function sshlog ssh_log() {
  ### When youâ€™re logged in via SSH use the following command to view 
  # last 100 lines of your SSH log:
  #
  ## tail /var/log/auth.log -n 100
  # or even cleaner
  tail -100 /var/log/auth.log | grep 'sshd'
}

### UBUNTU
  grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

  echo "In order to display extra information about the failed SSH logins, issue the command:"

### REDHAT (slightly modified commands)

  #egrep "Failed|Failure" /var/log/secure
  #grep "Failed" /var/log/secure
  # grep "authentication failure" /var/log/secure
